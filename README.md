This was my Capstone project for Physics 77: Introduction to Computational Physics, which I took in Fall 2024. The code simulates scalar active matter (Active Brownian Particles) under square harmonic boundary conditions with Yukawa and contact repulsion forces and analyzes the resulting data. 

This was completed in a group with Damian Paul and Jose Rendon.

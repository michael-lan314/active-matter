My Capstone project for Physics 77: Introduction to Computational Physics, which I took in Fall 2024. The code simulates scalar active matter (Active Brownian Particles) under square harmonic boundary conditions with Yukawa and contact repulsion forces and analyzes the resulting data. We successfully replicated the emergent effects of crystallization and phase transitions in ABP systems.

This project was completed in a group with Damian Paul and Jose Rendon, under Professor Markus Hohle and Graduate Student Instructor Krish Desai.
